# MAMe dataset 🎨🤖
Museum Art Mediums image classification task solved by [Laia Borrell Araunabeña ](https://github.com/Laiaborrell) and [Mario Lozano Cortés](https://github.com/SrLozano), Artificial Intelligence master's students at _Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya · BarcelonaTech - UPC_. The resolution of this task is part of the Deep Learning subject.

## Goal of the project 💥💯
Get the highest possible accuracy on the test set.

## The dataset 🗂🖼
The MAMe dataset is a novel image classification task focused on museum art mediums. Data is gathered from three different museums:

- The Metropolitan Museum of Art of New York.
- The Los Angeles County Museum of Art.
- The Cleveland Museum of Art.

Data from all museums is aggregated by art experts into 29 classes of mediums (i.e., materials and techniques).

The MAMe dataset is originally introduced in the paper [The MAMe Dataset: On the relevance of High Resolution and Variable Shape image properties](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.13693). Although here in this project only 256x256 images version of the dataset is considered, the original MAMe dataset with high-resolution images of variable shape can be download from its oficial [website](https://storage.hpai.bsc.es/mame-dataset/MAMe_data.zip). Additionally, a set of baseline models and code used to train them is available in the oficial github [repository](https://github.com/HPAI-BSC/MAMe-baselines).
